## 🏗️ AI Development Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Problem Definition & Planning
- **Business Problem**: Customer churn in telecommunications industry
- **Objectives**: 
  - Predict which customers are likely to churn
  - Identify key factors driving customer churn
  - Provide actionable insights to retention teams
- **Success Metrics**: Accuracy > 85%, Precision > 80%, Recall > 75%

### Stage 2: Data Collection & Preparation
- Synthetic customer data generation (1000 samples)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Train-test split (80-20)

### Stage 3: Model Selection & Training
- Multiple algorithms implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

### Stage 4: Model Evaluation
- Comprehensive performance metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC scores
  - Confusion matrices
- Model comparison and selection

### Stage 5: Deployment Considerations
